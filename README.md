A plugin for measuring blogging activity with various metrics

# What Is Blog Audit?

Blog Audit is a WordPress plugin which helps you audit your blogging process. It does that by tracking 4 types of activities and match those activities with your blogging goals. The matched activities are:

* posting speed
* comment density
* category distribution (goal setting functionality not yet included in the first release)
* pingback volume

You can establish goals for each of these activities and Blog Audit will indicate if you reach them. Goals can be established in a variety of ways: per post, per day, per week or per month, depending on the specific activity. Please note that in the first release goal setting for category distribution is not yet included.
